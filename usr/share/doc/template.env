#
# OpenSVC config files are written in standard ini file format:
#
# "The configuration file consists of sections, led by a [section] header and
# followed by name: value entries, with continuations in the style of RFC 822
# (see section 3.1.1, “LONG HEADER FIELDS”); name=value is also accepted. Note
# that leading whitespace is removed from values.
# Lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored and may be used to provide
# comments."
#               extract from http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
#
# Resource are label [resource_name#index_in_resourse_set], like [ip#1],
# [ip#2], [fs#1], [fs#2]...
#
# Every resource accept these options:
# 'disable'
#   optional. Possible values are 'true' or 'false'. Default is 'false'.
#   A disabled resource will be ignored on service startup and shutdown.
#
# 'disable_on'
#   optional. A list of nodenames where to consider the 'disable' value is
#   True. Also accepts the keywords 'nodes' and 'drpnodes'.
#
# 'optional'
#   optional. Possible values are 'true' or 'false'. Default is 'false'.
#   Actions on resource will be tried upon service startup and shutdown,
#   but action failures will be logged and passed over. Useful for resources
#   like dump filesystems for example.
#
# 'optional_on'
#   optional. A list of nodenames where to consider the 'optional' value is
#   True. Also accepts the keywords 'nodes' and 'drpnodes'.
#
# 'monitor'
#   optional. Possible values are 'true' or 'false'. Default is 'false'.
#   If set to 'true' the resource being down when the heartbeat thinks the
#   service should be 'up' triggers the execution of the 'monitor_action'.
#
# 'monitor_on'
#   optional. A list of nodenames where to consider the 'monitor' value is
#   True. Also accepts the keywords 'nodes' and 'drpnodes'.
#
# 'pre_start'
# 'post_start'
# 'pre_stop'
# 'post_stop'
# 'pre_syncnodes'
# 'post_syncnodes'
# 'pre_syncdrp'
# 'post_syncdrp'
# 'pre_syncresync'
# 'post_syncresync'
#   optional. A command or script to exec before or after the resource
#   action. Arguments can be passed, but a single command is accepted.
#
#
# Every service config file must have a DEFAULT section.
